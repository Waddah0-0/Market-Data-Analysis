📊 Market Data Analysis - Shiny Web App
A fully interactive R Shiny application for analyzing market transaction data. This tool allows users to upload CSV files, visualize spending patterns, perform clustering analysis, and generate association rules using the Apriori algorithm.

🌟 Features

Removes duplicates and outliers

Checks for missing values

Visual Analytics

Spending by Payment Type

Spending by Age Group

Spending by City

Total Spending Distribution

Customer Segmentation

K-Means Clustering based on age and total spending

Market Basket Analysis

Apriori-based Association Rule Mining

Adjustable support & confidence thresholds

Displays only strong rules (lift > 1.2)

📁 File Structure
.
├── app.R             # Complete Shiny application code (UI + Server)
├── README.md         # Project description and usage
└── sample-data.csv   # (Optional) Sample dataset for testing

⚙️ Requirements
Before running the app, make sure you have the following R packages installed:
install.packages(c(
  "shiny", "ggplot2", "plotly", "arules", 
  "arulesViz", "shinythemes", "DT", 
  "readxl", "dplyr"
))

🚀 How to Run
1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/market-data-analysis.git
cd market-data-analysis

2.Open app.R in RStudio or run it from your terminal using:
shiny::runApp("app.R")

📂 Data Format
Your uploaded .csv file must include the following columns:
Column Name | Description
total | Total amount spent
paymentType | Payment method used (e.g., cash, credit)
age | Age of the customer
city | City of the customer
customer | Unique customer ID
items | Comma-separated items bought (for Apriori)

🧪 How It Works
🔍 Data Cleaning
Duplicates are removed using unique().

Outliers in the count field are removed using boxplot$out.

Missing values are checked and handled.

📊 Visualization
Aggregates and plots total spending across payment types, age groups, and cities using barplot() and hist().

🤖 Clustering
Applies K-means clustering to group customers based on age and total spending.

Number of clusters is selectable between 2 and 4.

🔗 Association Rules
Converts the items column into transaction sets.

Applies the Apriori algorithm (from arules package).

Only rules with lift > 1.2 are shown.
